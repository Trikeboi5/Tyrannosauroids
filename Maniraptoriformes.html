<p>Maniraptoriforms are Therapods with long arms that contained 3 fingers and were quite heavily covered in feathers in most cases. They varied a lot in size with some smaller than cats to some around the size of Tyrannosaurus</p>
<h2><strong><u>Classification</u><strong></h2>
<p>Maniraptoriforms are divided into 7 main groups,the ostrich like Ornithomimosaurians, and the Maniraptorans: the small Alvarezsauroids, the largest of them the Therizinosaurids, the crested Oviraptorosaurs, the fast and famous Dromaesaurids, the clever Troodontids, and the only group containing alive species of Dinosaurs, the Avials</p>

<h3><strong><u>Ornithomimosaurs</u></strong></h3>

<p>Ornithomimosauria means "bird-mimic-lizards" derived from how they straight up resemble ostriches in their body and posture. They are considered Omnivores eating insects and plants and some are also considered just Herbivores</p>
<p>Ornithomimosaurs are known for being very fast reaching speeds of 30 miles per hour though only through the Ornithomimids who range from turkey-sized to medium-sized therapods while the Deinocheirids went from medium-sized to the large Deinocheirus which was bigger than most carnivorous therapods, and a very weird one too would have not been so fast</p>
<p>Ornithomimosaurs bore a decent amount of feathering and had very long arms and legs which aided them in reaching their incredible speeds and are known to have been social and herd in decently large groups </p>

<p>The true Maniraptorans:</p>

<h3><strong><u>Alvarezsauroids</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Mononykus olecranus</i></small></p>
<p>Alvarezsauroids are very small and fast Maniraptorans boasting a great deal of feathering though not arms as long as other Maniraptorans</p>
<p>Alvarezsauroids had small and pointed teeth suggesting that they ate insects and other small animals</p>
<p>Alvarezsauroids were named after the Argentine historian Gregorio √Ålvarez for his contributions to Argentina's history and culture</p>

<h3><strong><u>Therizinosaurids</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Therizinosaurus cheloniformis</i></small></p>
<p>Therizinosaurids were huge sloth-like omnivores(eating plants and insects) ranging from medium sized therapods to the taller than T-rex Therizinosaurus which also came at the length of medium sized therapods bearing decently long necks</p>
<p>Therizinosaurids are known for their humongous claws much bigger than any other Dinosaur, though being fragile limited them to be used for bicking berries and insects off of trees and the floor similar to Anteaters rather then intense combat like Wolverine</p>
<p>Therizinosaurids are believed to have complex brains and have developed social skills, and possibly form small herds</p>

<h3><strong><u>Oviraptorosaurs</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i></small></p>
<p>Oviraptorosaurs are omnivores covered well in feathers known for their semicircle crests on their heads. Most of them are medium sized Therapods while their biggest, Gigantoraptor was as tall as some of the biggest Therapods</p>
<p>Oviraptorosaurs were quite fast and unlike most other Therapods had a big parrot-like beaks which suggested the plant-based portion of their diet</p>
<p>Oviraptoroids, unlike most Maniraptorans have shorter tails reducing their length while bearing longer necks similar to Therizinosaurids and Ornithomimosaurians</p>

<h3><strong><u>Dromaesaurids</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Deinonychus antirrhopus</i></small></p>
<p>Dromaesaurids are small and fast carnivorous Maniraptorans who were well covered in feathers</p>
<p>Dromaesaurids are distinguished by their signature sickle claw on both of their feet on the inner toe of each and range in size with most being the size of a turkey or slightly bigger and getting up to 6-7 feet tall like the Achillobator, Austroraptor and the biggest, Utahraptor</p>
<p>Dromaesauridae means "running-lizards", an appropriate name considering that they were relatively small, had streamlined bodies, and a long, somewhat stiff tail to help keep balance and change direction and pack hunting is still not a confirmed hypothesis in Dromaesaurids</p>

<h3><strong><u>Troodontids</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Stenonychosaurus inequalis</i></small></p>
<p>Troodontids were very small, feathered carnivores and were the closest relative group to the Avials, with most of them being the size of a Turkey or Chicken</p>
<p>Similar to Dromaesaurids, Troodontids have a sickle claw on their inner toes, and were built for speed, and their namesake genus "Troodon" being declared invalid, with most of its remains being assigned to "Stenonychosaurus"</p>
<p>Troodontids had more forward pointing eyes, similar to Tyrannosaurids proving that they had binocular vision, and had many teeth packed closely together</p>

<h3><strong><u>Avials</u></strong></h3>

<p><small>Depiction of <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i></small></p>
<p>Avials are Omnivorous, or sometimes just plain Herbivorous, Carnivorous, Insectivorous or Piscivorous Dinosaurs that contains Birds and all their closest relatives which are feathered, have wings and were able to take flight</p>
<p>Avials were not only the first Dinosaurs, but first Vertebrates to take to the skies and made a revolutionary acheivement which is also the only group of Dinosaurs alive today(mostly) with 10,000 species still going strong</p>
<p>Most Avials are Birds though around 20-30 recorded genera are extinct such as Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis</p>
