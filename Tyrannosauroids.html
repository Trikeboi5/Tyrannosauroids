<p>Tyrannosauroids are Therapods which arrived in the Jurassic period bearing quite a bit of feathering and later dominated in the Northern Hemisphere of the Cretaceous growing bigger in size and slowly losing some of their feathers.
<h2><strong><u>Classification</u><strong></h2>
<p>Tyrannosauroids are divided into 2 main families, the smaller crested Proceratosaurids and the larger ferocious Tyrannosaurids(and the primitive family Dryptosauridae which only includes Dryptosaurus and Cryptotyrannus and quite a few not in any more specific group such as Eotyrannus, Dilong, Xiangguanlong, etc.)

<h3><strong><u>Proceratosaurids</u></strong></h3>

<p>Proceratosaurids vary a little in size, with most being a little bigger than a turkey while a few being medium sized therapods</p>
<p>Proceratosaurids have the feature of having a crest on the top of their head which might have been used for mating display</p>
<p>Proceratosaurids had 3 fingers on their arms and would have had  quite a lot amount of feathering

<p>Tyrannosaurids go from medium-sized to some of the largest Therapods to ever rule the land with less feather found on the large ones such as Tyrannosaurus which might have even had no feathering</p>
<p>Tyrannosaurids are characterized by the crests that go over their eyes and having 2 fingers on each of their tiny arms and chonkier bodies than their relatives</p>
<p>Tyrannosaurids were the apex predators of each of their ecosystem with relatively shorter snouts compared to most other therapods and big, rounder slightly serated teeth perfect for their crushing bites</p>
